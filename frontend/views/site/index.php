                <p>BiddulphBargains believe that getting a great deal is never a bad thing. However in small towns such as Biddulph,
				bargains and offers that are available are only spread through word of mouth and the occasional newsletter. Having all those
				offers available on one website will not only help you find the best deals, but also help strengthen the towns economy.</p>
